# Housing-Price-Prediction-King-County-Dataset
Housing Price Prediction â€“ King County Dataset. I explored predicting the market price of a house based on its features. Using the King County housing dataset, I analyzed attributes like square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of floors, waterfront view, grade, and more to understand their impact on house prices.
